My Evolutionary Computing Lecture Project Codes Relies Here In Peace.</br>
</br>
HW1:</br>
Solving 8-Queens problem with Genetic Algorithm.</br>
</br>
</br>
HW2:</br>
Solving a problem like Colonel Blotto with Genetic Algorithm.</br>
My task here is to implement the genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve the colonels’ strategies.</br>
Then I made an experiment with different parameter setups. Here are some parameters that I did experiment with:</br>
1. Implementing different mutation operator.</br>
2. Implementing different selection mechanism.</br>
3. Incorporating mentioned factors in the project description pdf file into my code for simulating a war.</br>
</br>
</br>
HW3:</br>
Solving System Reliability Optimization problem with Evolutionary Strategy Algorithm.</br>
In this project I asked to design an Evolution Strategy (ES) based approach to reach this goal.</br>
Project Idea is taken from this paper: </br>
P. Wu, L. Gao, D. Zou, and S. Li, “An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for reliability problems,” ISA Trans., vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 71–81, 2011.

HW4:</br>
Implementing a paper inside its folder.</br>
